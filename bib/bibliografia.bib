  abstract={Multilevel inverter technology has emerged recently as a very important alternative in the area of high-power medium-voltage energy control. This paper presents the most important topologies like diode-clamped inverter (neutral-point clamped), capacitor-clamped (flying capacitor), and cascaded multicell with separate DC sources. Emerging topologies like asymmetric hybrid cells and soft-switched multilevel inverters are also discussed. This paper also presents the most relevant control and modulation methods developed for this family of converters: multilevel sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation, multilevel selective harmonic elimination, and space-vector modulation. Special attention is dedicated to the latest and more relevant applications of these converters such as laminators, conveyor belts, and unified power-flow controllers. The need of an active front end at the input side for those inverters supplying regenerative loads is also discussed, and the circuit topology options are also presented. Finally, the peripherally developing areas such as high-voltage high-power devices and optical sensors and other opportunities for future development are addressed.},

  abstract={Much of the credit for 20th-century advances in computing and communication goes to the silicon transistor and the integrated circuit. The same may be said for the silicon insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) with respect to the impending revolution taking place in energy technology. The silicon IGBT offers unprecedented energy efficiency when switching electrical power in the range of few hundred kilowatts to multimegawatts at a low manufacturing cost. It is transforming the electric utility, transportation, telecommunication, manufacturing, and medical infrastructures in a manner never seen before. This article pertains to the discovery and demonstration of early IGBT devices.},

	abstract={During the past two decades, solid-state transformers (SSTs) have evolved quickly and have been considered for replacing conventional low-frequency (LF) transformers in applications such as traction, where weight and volume savings and substantial efficiency improvements can be achieved, or in smart grids because of their controllability. As shown in this article, all main modern SST topologies realize the common key characteristics of these transformers-medium-frequency (MF) isolation stage, connection to medium voltage (MV), and controllability-by employing combinations of a very few key concepts, which have been described or patented as early as the 1960s. But still, key research challenges concerning protection, isolation, and reliability remain.},

	pages={2155-2163},
	abstract={Wide bandgap semiconductors show superior material properties enabling potential power device operation at higher temperatures, voltages, and switching speeds than current Si technology. As a result, a new generation of power devices is being developed for power converter applications in which traditional Si power devices show limited operation. The use of these new power semiconductor devices will allow both an important improvement in the performance of existing power converters and the development of new power converters, accounting for an increase in the efficiency of the electric energy transformations and a more rational use of the electric energy. At present, SiC and GaN are the more promising semiconductor materials for these new power devices as a consequence of their outstanding properties, commercial availability of starting material, and maturity of their technological processes. This paper presents a review of recent progresses in the development of SiC- and GaN-based power semiconductor devices together with an overall view of the state of the art of this new device generation.},

	title={An improved modulation strategy for a hybrid multilevel inverter},
	year={2000},
	volume={4},
	pages={2086-2093 vol.4},
	abstract={Multilevel cascaded and hybrid inverter systems conventionally use three level bipolar PWM for each individual inverter, with their carriers phase shifted to achieve maximum harmonic cancellation within each phase leg. This has been shown to give a harmonic performance equivalent to APOD modulation of a NPC multilevel inverter, when the switching frequencies are scaled to achieve the same number of overall switch transitions. In contrast, PD modulation of a NPC inverter is harmonically superior, because it places harmonic energy directly into the carrier harmonic for each phase leg, and relies on cancellation of this harmonic across phase legs as the line-to-line voltage is developed. Using this understanding, a new discontinuous modulation strategy is proposed for a hybrid inverter which achieves a similar level of improvement in line-to-line harmonics compared to conventional three level modulation of this type of inverter},
